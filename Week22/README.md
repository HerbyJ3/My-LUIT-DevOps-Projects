1. Create an EKS cluster with a desired capacity of 2
2. Create a random string that allows 5 characters to build the cluster name
2. We want to output the cluster name and the ip address of the containers in the cluster.


NOTE: all code should be in module blocks, not resource blocks

This should be deployed using your local env and terraform cloud



NOTE: DO NOT FORGET TO SET YOUR  ACCESS KEY, SECRET ACCESS KEY AND REGION ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES IN TERRAFORM CLOUD


Good Luck
